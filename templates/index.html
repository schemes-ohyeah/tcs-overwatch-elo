            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>All data viewed on this website is either scraped from Tespa's official website, Overbuff, or calculated from the scraped data.</p>

            <h4>1. Calculating Average SR</h4>
            <p>When scraping team members from Tespa's website, only official players were taken. This excluded team managers / coordinators and substitutes.</p>
            <p>Their Battle Tag was queried to Overbuff to find their skill rating. However, do note that if a person was unranked, they would be excluded from the average calculation. If for some reason, the roster contained more than 6 players on the starting roster, only the top 6 ranked players would be factored into the calculation.</p>
            <p>Scraping skill rating from Overbuff is a lengthy process as it requires visiting the individual page for each player (over 1400 players). As such, <em>skill ratings will not be updated</em> <strong>(EDIT: Due to popular request, skill ratings have been updated for Towers of Doom!)</strong> and will only be used as a Week 0 starting point, since Elo by the end of the competition will be more accurate than subtle SR changes.</p>

            <h4>2. Calculating Elo</h4>
            <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Rather than initially seeding teams with average SR, the new system will start all teams at 1500 and use a new &kappa; value of 150.</p>
            <p>Rather than calculating Elo after every match (bo3 / bo5), it is updated after every map so that matches going 2&ndash;1 will result in a different result than a 2&ndash;0.</p>
            <p>Elo is calculated using some math found <a href="https://metinmediamath.wordpress.com/2013/11/27/how-to-calculate-the-elo-rating-including-example/" target="_blank">here</a> with the &kappa; value being set to 150 (previously 50), meaning for each game, a team could gain or lose no more than 150 Elo.</p>
            <p><em>Note: </em> Elo ratings are calculated and stored to floating point decimal accuracy but are displayed as rounded to 0 or 2 decimals for UI purposes. Viewing raw JSON files will display full decimal accuracy.</p>

            <h4>3. Predicting Future Matches</h4>
            <p>Using a team's most recent elo, predictions of future matches can be calculated using some math found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/2y6ezm/how_to_guide_converting_elo_differences_to/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

            <h4>Additional Details</h4>
            <p>This site runs off an Ubuntu based server running Python 3.6 and the Flask web micro-framework. All scraped data is saved to and served from json files rather than SQL tables. You may view the source code <a href="https://github.com/schemes-ohyeah/tcs-overwatch-elo">here.</a></p>
